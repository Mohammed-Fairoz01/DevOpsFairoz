You are given a string that contains both letters and digits. Write a program to separate the letters from the digits and store them in separate arrays. How could you optimize your program to handle very large input strings efficiently?
Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs all possible permutations of the characters in the string. How could you optimize your program to handle long input strings with many repeated characters?
You are given two strings. Write a program to find the longest common substring between the two strings. How could you optimize your program to handle very long input strings efficiently?
Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the longest palindrome substring in the string. How could you optimize your program to handle very long input strings efficiently?
